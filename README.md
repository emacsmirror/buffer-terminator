The **buffer-terminator** package automatically terminates inactive buffers to help maintain a clean and efficient workspace, while also improving Emacs' performance by reducing the number of open buffers, thereby decreasing the number of active modes, timers, and other processes associated with those inactive buffers.

By default, the following buffers are not terminated: buffers whose names start with a space, start and end with `*`, and buffers whose major mode is derived from `special-mode`.

When a buffer is not a special buffer (e.g., a file-visiting or dired buffer), only buffers that have been inactive for a specified period are terminated. (Exception: modified file-visiting buffers that have not been saved are not terminated; the user must save them first.)

(`(buffer-terminator-mode)` terminates all the buffers that have been inactive for longer than the duration specified by `buffer-terminator-inactivity-timeout` (Default: 30 minutes). It checks every `buffer-terminator-interval` - Default: 10 minutes - to determine if a buffer should be terminated.)

## Features

- Automatically terminates/kills inactive buffers based on a configurable timeout.
- Excludes specific buffers using buffer names, regular expressions, or special buffer types.
- Verbose mode for logging terminated buffers.
- Supports customizable intervals for periodic cleanup.
- Ensures special buffers and important user-defined buffers are preserved.

## Installation

### Install with straight (Emacs version < 30)

To install `buffer-terminator` with `straight.el`:

1. It if hasn't already been done, [add the straight.el bootstrap code](https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) to your init file.
2. Add the following code to the Emacs init file:
```emacs-lisp
(use-package buffer-terminator
  :ensure t
  :straight (buffer-terminator
             :type git
             :host github
             :repo "jamescherti/buffer-terminator.el")
  :custom
  (buffer-terminator-verbose nil)
  :config
  (buffer-terminator-mode 1))
```

### Installing with use-package and :vc (Built-in feature in Emacs version >= 30)

To install `buffer-terminator` with `use-package` and `:vc` (Emacs >= 30):

``` emacs-lisp
(use-package buffer-terminator
  :ensure t
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/jamescherti/buffer-terminator.el"
       :rev :newest)
  :custom
  (buffer-terminator-verbose nil)
  :config
  (buffer-terminator-mode 1))
```

## Configuration

### Verbose Mode

Enable verbose mode to log buffer cleanup events:

```elisp
(setq buffer-terminator-verbose t)
```

### Timeout for Inactivity

Set the inactivity timeout (in seconds) after which buffers are considered inactive (default is 30 minutes):

```elisp
(setq buffer-terminator-inactivity-timeout (* 30 60)) ; 30 minutes
```

### Cleanup Interval

Define how frequently the cleanup process should run (default is every 10 minutes):

```elisp
(customize-set-variable 'buffer-terminator-interval (* 10 60)) ; 10 minutes
```

(Using `customize-set-variable` allows `buffer-terminator-interval` to update the timer dynamically, without the need to restart `buffer-terminator-mode`.)

## Frequently asked questions

### Why? What problem is this aiming to solve?

One reason to terminate inactive buffers is to improve Emacs' performance by reducing the number of open buffers. This, in turn, decreases the load from active modes, timers, and other processes associated with those buffers. Buffer-local modes and their timers consume both CPU and memory. Why keep them alive when they can be safely removed?

Another reason is to ensure that only the buffers the user actively needs remain open, helping to declutter the buffer list.
