The `buffer-terminator` Emacs package automatically terminates inactive buffers to help maintain a clean and efficient workspace. It also helps improve Emacs performance by reducing the number of open buffers.

It provides configurable options to determine which buffers to keep, a timeout for inactivity, and periodic cleanup intervals.

By default, `buffer-terminator-mode` terminates all file-visiting and dired buffers that have been inactive for longer than the duration specified by `buffer-terminator-inactivity-timeout`. Special buffers are ignored by default, but you can configure `buffer-terminator` to include them by adjusting the relevant option provided below.

## Features

- Automatically kills inactive buffers based on a configurable timeout.
- Excludes specific buffers using buffer names, regular expressions, or special buffer types.
- Verbose mode for logging terminated buffers.
- Supports customizable intervals for periodic cleanup.
- Ensures special buffers and important user-defined buffers are preserved.

## Installation

### Install with straight (Emacs version < 30)

To install `buffer-terminator` with `straight.el`:

1. It if hasn't already been done, [add the straight.el bootstrap code](https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) to your init file.
2. Add the following code to the Emacs init file:
```emacs-lisp
(use-package buffer-terminator
  :ensure t
  :straight (buffer-terminator
             :type git
             :host github
             :repo "jamescherti/buffer-terminator.el")
  :config
  (buffer-terminator-mode 1))
```

### Installing with use-package and :vc (Built-in feature in Emacs version >= 30)

To install `buffer-terminator` with `use-package` and `:vc` (Emacs >= 30):

``` emacs-lisp
(use-package buffer-terminator
  :demand t
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/jamescherti/buffer-terminator.el"
       :rev :newest)
  :config
    (buffer-terminator-mode 1))
```

## Configuration

### Timeout for Inactivity

Set the inactivity timeout (in seconds) after which buffers are considered inactive (default is 60 minutes):

```elisp
(setq buffer-terminator-inactivity-timeout (* 60 60)) ; 60 minutes
```

### Cleanup Interval

Define how frequently the cleanup process should run (default is every 5 minutes):

```elisp
(customize-set-variable
 'buffer-terminator-kill-buffers-interval (* 5 60)) ; 5 minutes
```

(Using `customize-set-variable` allows `buffer-terminator-kill-buffers-interval` to update the timer dynamically, without the need to restart `buffer-terminator-mode`.)

### Verbose Mode

Enable verbose mode to log buffer cleanup events:

```elisp
(setq buffer-terminator-verbose t)
```

### Preserve Special Buffers

Keep all special buffers by setting the following option to `t`:

```elisp
(setq buffer-terminator-keep-special-buffers t)
```

**IMPORTANT:** It is generally NOT recommended to set this to nil. If you choose to set it to nil, ensure that the special buffers you want to keep are added to `buffer-terminator-ignore-buffer-names` and `buffer-terminator-ignore-buffer-regexps`.

### Ignore Specific Buffers

Exclude specific buffers from being killed by name:

```elisp
(setq buffer-terminator-ignore-buffer-names '("*scratch*"
                                              "*Messages*"
                                              "*Async-native-compile-log*"
                                              "*Compile-Log*"))
```

Or by regular expression:

```elisp
(setq buffer-terminator-ignore-buffer-regexps '("\\` \\*Minibuf-.*\\*\\'"
                                                "\\` \\*Echo Area "))
```

Keep in mind that when `buffer-terminator-keep-special-buffers` is set to `t`, special buffers that start and end with `*` are automatically ignored and will not be killed, even if they are not explicitly listed in `buffer-terminator-ignore-buffer-regexps` or `buffer-terminator-ignore-buffer-names`.
